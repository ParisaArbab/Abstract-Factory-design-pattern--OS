# Abstract-Factory-design-pattern--OS
 build a user interface framework for MS-Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring each platform's native look. 
 This involves creating abstract classes for text fields, push buttons, and list boxes, and
 then implementing specific subclasses for each platform.
 The Abstract Factory Design Pattern will be used to guarantee that all widgets are consistent with the chosen operating system. 
 The framework will display the component name and OS on the terminal.
